        <p>Apple alleged that NSO group created more than 100 fake Apple ID user credentials to carry out its attacks.The tech giant said that its servers were not hacked, but that NSO misused and manipulated the servers to deliver the attacks on Apple users.Apple also alleged that NSO Group was directly involved in providing consulting services for the spyware, but NSO maintains that it only sells its tools to clients.
        </p><p>Apple said it was forced to engage in a continual arms race with NSO, saying the Israeli firm was "constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple's own security upgrades".
        The iPhone maker said that it will donate $10m, as well as any damages recovered in the lawsuit, to cybersurveillance research groups including Citizen Lab, the University of Toronto group that first discovered NSO's attacks.

        <h2>Max Verstappen vs Lewis Hamilton: How the 2021 Formula 1 title could be clinched at Saudi Arabian GP</h2>
        <p><i>UF1's closest championship in years could be decided in inaugural Saudi Arabian GP.</i></p>
        <img src="https://cdn.motorsportmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/06113859/2021-Imola-Hamilton-v-Verstappen.jpg" width="60%">
        <p>Hamilton has claimed back-to-back victories to boost his chances, but Verstappen's eight-point lead means that if results go his way at the next race, the championship would not go down to the Abu Dhabi finale.</p>
        <p>Verstappen needs an advantage of 26 points after the first-ever race at Saudi Arabia's high-speed Jeddah street track, on December 5, to seal an early crown, meaning he has to outscore Hamilton by 18 points.</p>
        <b>RELATED NEWS|</b>
        <a href="https://www.skysports.com/f1/standings">How close is the F1 title battle</a>
        <p>There has been an 18-point swing or more between the pair just twice this season: in Monaco when Verstappen won and Hamilton was seventh, and at Silverstone where Hamilton won after the Verstappen crash.The pair could also go into the Abu Dhabi GP in an appealing 'winner takes all' scenario, while there is the possibility that they are level heading to that last race if Hamilton wins Jeddah with a fastest lap, and Verstappen is second.</p>
        <p>The constructors' battle is even less likely to be settled in Saudi Arabia, with Mercedes currently holding just a five-point advantage over Red Bull in what has been an increasingly bitter rivalry.
        Both drivers accrue points to the team's total, so there is a maximum of 44 up for grabs in Saudi Arabia with a race win (25 points) and a second place (18 points) - either with a fastest lap.</p>
